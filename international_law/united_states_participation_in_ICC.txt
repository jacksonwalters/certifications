Your honors,

The International Criminal Court is a progressive and bold institution of justice, forged in a world of nations which are in many ways isolated and distinct, despite recent advances in transportation and communication.

We can all see a distant future in which, perhaps, the world comes together as a collection of states, with common legal codes, currency, and language, but we are simply not there yet. 

The International Criminal Court is designed to handle war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity. There are 122 participating states, not including the United States, Russia, and several Middle Eastern countries.

If the United States were to submit to the jurisdiction of such a court, then it is entirely possible the whims of the international community or simply disagreement with United States policy would encourage prosecution of a former President. This would infringe on a United States executive to operate freely and carry out his constitutional duties while in office. 

Would we have simply submitted and extradited Barack Obama for what would be labeled "crimes against humanity" for civilian deaths in drone strikes? Would we stand idly by as he is subjected to a kangaroo court in which nations with interests that are not aligned with our own lay out a scene of "atrocities", holding the president responsible for wartime acts, which are authorized by the United States Congress?

This is an absurd world. While a governor may be held to the standards of federal law, we are simply not ready to begin holding Presidents to the standards of international law without much broader discussion, agreement, and essentially a worldwide constitution. 

Thank you.
