Your honors,

Under the precedent of Alstoetter Case, it is shown unequivocally that while it is impossible to bring every party to justice in the event of an atrocity, it is possible to examine the real responsibility of a few influential figures and bring them to justice.

For better or worse, we cannot change the past. It is written in stone. We have a duty and obligation to prevent a similar gross violation of human rights from occurring in the United States or anywhere in the world. 

When we examine the Yoo memorandums, we see a willful neglect of a theory of mind, an unwillingness to extend even the most basic empathy when delimiting the lines of torture. 

Wall standing, hooding, subjection to noise, sleep deprivation, and deprivation of food and drink, used in combination for a long period fall into the category of inhuman treatment, but not torture, since "they did not experience suffering of the particular intensity and cruelty implied by the word torture."

We disagree categorically with this bizarrely limited definition, which effectively rules out all but the most heinous acts, which even then presumably the boundary would be pushed further without limit. 

These memos were designed to encourage and provide legal cover for inhuman acts which were demonstrably perpetrated. Now that it is clear the effects of these memos, it is time to make it clear that writing such a permissive doctrine should carry legal responsibility. 

When an act causes material harm to another human being, there should be recourse in court.

Thank you.
