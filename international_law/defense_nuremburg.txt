Your honors,

During the course of this trial we will see reprehensible acts of violence, neglect, and human cruelty. These acts were committed during wartime in my country, Germany. 

We all seek justice when terrible things happen, we seek to balance the scales in some way. We seek to determine who is responsible, and cause them some proportional amount of suffering, or at least not allow them to walk freely when they were an irreducible component in inflicting harm.

In this case, do we really believe that a handful of evil men were responsible for the atrocities that were committed? Do we think the chain of cause-and-effect originates with a few people? That a fervor and bloodlust that swept through an entire nation was manipulated and guided by the hands of a few figureheads? 

In this trial we are not asking if terrible events occurred. They did. We are asking who is responsible. I submit that it is the German people as a collective, and we will pay penance for decades. However, don't fool yourselves into thinking justice will be served by chopping off the heads of a few men. For then justice will truly be blind.

Thank you.
