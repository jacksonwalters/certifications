Look at the DSM-V definitions and patient data to obtain symptom-level data columns. 

That is, the constellation of symptoms from the DSM-V would represent a number of categories (schizophrenic, schizoaffective, bipolar, etc.).

Each patient would have symptoms (anxious, depressed, manic), and life factors (no income, no housing, no health insurance, etc.).

The idea would be to then map patients into their appropriate category based on symptoms and life factors, ideally using something like PCA (principal component analysis) or t-SNE. 

These are dimensionality reduction techniques and result in a 2d plot.

This has been done at least once with a small dataset. Could do it again with a bigger/different dataset.

3/3/2024: Progress report, notes.

I have successfully mapped the high dimensional data via t-SNE using both sklearn and the GPU accelerated cuML.

I dropped columns that were not diagnostic, leaving 7. They are 

*TRAUSTREFLG=Trauma- and stressor-related disorders
*ANXIETYFLG=Anxiety disorders
*ADHDFLG=Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
*BIPOLARFLG=Bipolar disorders
*DEPRESSFLG=Depressive disorders
*SCHIZOFLG=Schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders
*PERSONFLG=Personality disorders

Since diagnoses are binary 0/1, with 7 columns that gives 2^7=128 'categories'. I simplified labeling "pure diagnoses", a zero for "no diagnosis", and one for "multi-diagnosis" yielding eight categories which can then be colored.

Initial plots are promising, showing clustering among the eight categoregories, and scattering of the multi-symptom diagnoses.

Next steps could try to do a sort of prediction. That is, look at the other data, and see if you can predict which category they're going to belong to.

We would basically take the remaining columns, whatever they are, and do a similar clustering. We'll have the labels available, so one can literally just see if the clusters are the same.

It is possible to do correlations of those two t-SNE's as they are just two column dataframes.
